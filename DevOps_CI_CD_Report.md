# DevOps CI/CD Report for AgriConnect

This document outlines the Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) pipeline setup for the AgriConnect project. The goal is to ensure automated testing, building, and deployment of the application to streamline the development workflow.

## CI/CD Pipeline Overview

The CI/CD pipeline for AgriConnect is designed to automate the following stages:
1. **Code Integration:** Automatically trigger builds and tests on every code push to the repository.
2. **Testing:** Run unit tests, integration tests, and linting checks to ensure code quality.
3. **Build:** Package the application for deployment.
4. **Deployment:** Deploy the application to a staging or production environment.

## Tools and Services Used

* **Version Control:** GitHub
* **CI/CD Platform:** GitHub Actions
* **Containerization:** Docker (optional for deployment)
* **Hosting:** Cloud-based hosting (e.g., AWS, Azure, or Heroku)
* **Monitoring:** Tools like Prometheus or New Relic (future enhancement)

## GitHub Actions Workflow

The CI/CD pipeline is implemented using GitHub Actions. Below is an example workflow configuration:

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout Code
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Set up Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: 14

    - name: Install Dependencies
      run: npm install

    - name: Run Linting
      run: npm run lint

    - name: Run Tests
      run: npm test

  deploy:
    needs: build-and-test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'

    steps:
    - name: Checkout Code
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Deploy to Production
      run: |
        echo "Deploying application..."
        # Add deployment commands here (e.g., Docker, Heroku CLI, AWS CLI)
```

## Deployment Strategy

The deployment strategy for AgriConnect can be tailored based on the hosting platform. Below are some common approaches:

1. **Dockerized Deployment:**
   * Build a Docker image of the application and push it to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, AWS ECR).
   * Deploy the container to a cloud platform (e.g., AWS ECS, Kubernetes).

2. **Cloud Deployment (AWS, Azure, GCP):**
   * Use the respective CLI tools (e.g., AWS CLI, Azure CLI) to deploy the application to a cloud environment.

3. **Azure Deployment:**
   * Deploy the application to Azure App Service using the Azure CLI or GitHub Actions.
   * Example Azure CLI commands:
     ```bash
     # Login to Azure
     az login

     # Create a resource group
     az group create --name AgriConnectResourceGroup --location eastus

     # Create an App Service plan
     az appservice plan create --name AgriConnectPlan --resource-group AgriConnectResourceGroup --sku F1

     # Create a web app
     az webapp create --name AgriConnectApp --resource-group AgriConnectResourceGroup --plan AgriConnectPlan --runtime "NODE|16-lts"

     # Deploy the application
     az webapp deployment source config-local-git --name AgriConnectApp --resource-group AgriConnectResourceGroup
     git remote add azure $(az webapp deployment source config-local-git --name AgriConnectApp --resource-group AgriConnectResourceGroup --query url --output tsv)
     git push azure main
     ```

   * Alternatively, use GitHub Actions for automated deployment:
     ```yaml
     name: Deploy to Azure

     on:
       push:
         branches:
           - main

     jobs:
       build-and-deploy:
         runs-on: ubuntu-latest

         steps:
         - name: Checkout Code
           uses: actions/checkout@v3

         - name: Set up Node.js
           uses: actions/setup-node@v3
           with:
             node-version: 16

         - name: Install Dependencies
           run: npm install

         - name: Build Application
           run: npm run build

         - name: Deploy to Azure Web App
           uses: azure/webapps-deploy@v2
           with:
             app-name: AgriConnectApp
             slot-name: production
             publish-profile: ${{ secrets.AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE }}
     ```

## Future Enhancements

* **Blue-Green Deployment:** Minimize downtime during deployments by maintaining two identical environments.
* **Canary Releases:** Gradually roll out new features to a subset of users.
* **Automated Rollbacks:** Implement rollback mechanisms in case of deployment failures.
* **Monitoring and Alerts:** Integrate monitoring tools to track application performance and send alerts for issues.

## Conclusion

The CI/CD pipeline for AgriConnect ensures a streamlined and automated workflow for code integration, testing, and deployment. This setup reduces manual effort, improves code quality, and accelerates the delivery of new features.
